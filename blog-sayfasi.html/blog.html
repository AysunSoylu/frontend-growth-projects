    <h2>Home Decoration</h2>
    <p>
        The subject of home decoration is a very popular subject today. It is an area with many details, ranging from wall paint to the wood of the floor, paintings, cabinets, armchairs, bathroom tiles and door handles. This home decoration subject is generally popular paints and woods are used by homeowners, but instead of drowning in these popular options, I choose different options. I look at houses with home decoration more admiringly because I think every house reflects its owner, just as we all have different characters and lifestyles, I think it would be more correct and pleasant for their houses to look different. Houses with very different touches attract my attention much more, for example, the combination of wood and leather in the sofa. It will add a very different atmosphere.

    <p>
        If we consider the initial phase of each child, this process starts in the womb and continues until we are approximately 18 years old. There are points at this stage that we need to be very careful and sensitive about, and every parent should approach these points very carefully and attentively. On the other hand, it is quite common for us to encounter different bad results in cases where we do not pay this attention. We face this situation as a situation: there are many details and work to be done, from toilet training to developing their motor development, activities that will improve their social emotional intelligence and bring them to a very good level, and doing studies that will improve their mathematical or verbal intelligence. It is up to parents to raise our children very well, especially in the communicative sense. 
    </p>
    <h3>Correct ways to communicate with the child</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Speak by bending down or kneeling at his/her level, eye contact is very important here.</li>
        <li>Always use affirmations that show you understand</li>
        <li>When there is a problem, try to find common solutions</li>
    </ul>
