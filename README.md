# Frontend Growth Projects

This repository contains a collection of small front-end projects that I developed as part of my learning journey in front-end development. The projects are focused on building core skills using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS.

Each project is designed to explore a specific front-end concept or feature, aiming to strengthen my understanding of responsive design, interactivity, and modern UI development.
